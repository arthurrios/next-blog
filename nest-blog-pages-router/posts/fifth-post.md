# Sustainable Growth Strategies

Expanding your e-commerce business requires careful planning. Our platform provides the tools you need to scale *without* sacrificing customer experience.

## Key Scaling Features

1. **Inventory Management**  
   Handle increased demand with our REST API:

   ```python
   # Set low stock alert
   def set_stock_alert(product_id, threshold):
       db.update('products', 
           where={'id': product_id},
           data={'low_stock_threshold': threshold}
       ).then(
           lambda: publish_alert('stock', product_id)
       )
   ```

   - Automated stock alerts
   - Supplier integration
   - Multi-location tracking

2. Order Processing Automation  
   Streamline fulfillment with:
   - Batch order processing
   - Shipping label generation

3. *Customer Support Scaling*  
   Maintain service quality through:
   - Helpdesk ticketing system
   - AI-powered chatbots

   Track growth metrics with our monitoring SDK:

   ```javascript
   // Track custom performance metrics
   perf.monitor('checkout_flow', {
     entryPoint: 'cart_view',
     metrics: ['load_time', 'render_time', 'api_latency'],
     thresholds: {
       load_time: 2000,
       render_time: 500
     }
   });
   ```

   | Metric          | Threshold | Alert Channel |
